This project serves the purpose to showcase RSA encryption in python in an understandable and readable matter.

The encryption module is currently somewhat buggy if not used with regular characters.
I am planning to building it out to encompass modern encryption methods while generating most of the variables automatically.

Also, I will work on the decryption tool whenever I have time.
